This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This repository is a companion to an article I wrote [When To Use useState vs useReducer Hook In React](https://www.oncrashreboot.com/when-to-use-usestate-vs-usereducer-hook-in-react).

It is also available on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/talha131/onCrashReboot-react-state-hook-example).
